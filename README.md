# Xmas-Calendar-Static-Web-App
A Xmas calendar based on an Azure static web app.

A single page app (plain html/js/css) accesses an API to present a picture very day. The API is maintained in a separate repo [XMas-API](https://github.com/cyberbartels/XMas-API).
The frontend is a modified version of a grid based calendar found in this [tutorial](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-festive-advent-calendar-with-css-grid--cms-30070) by Ian Yates.
